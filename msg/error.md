# Understanding Error Messages

Error messages provide valuable information about what went wrong and can help identify the root cause of an issue. The first few lines of an error message are particularly important as they show the actual error message and often suggest how to fix it. The remaining lines of the error message show the 'stack' of function calls that led to the error, which can be useful for tracking down more complicated issues.

## Example of Reading an Error Message

Here is an example of how to read an error message, using the following boxes as a reference:

1. The actual error message specifies what the error is. In this case, the error message indicates that the user has a different number of `x` and `y` values for the `plot` function.
2. The line where the actual error occurs. In this case, the error occurs in a function made by the user.
3. The line where the function is called in the main code.
4. The actual mistake causing all the errors.

This example shows two parts of the problem:

1. From the perspective of the software (in this case, MATLAB), the issue is that `x` and `y` in `plot(x,y)` are not the same size. The error can be traced from the main code (box 3) all the way to the root cause (box 1). The exact issue is also specified in box 1.
2. From the user's perspective, the actual mistake is in box 4, where they made an error in setting the `x` values. This mistake is not directly implied by the error message, and it requires experience and insight to identify.

## Tips for Dealing with Error Messages

Here are some tips for dealing with error messages:

- Stay calm and read through the error message carefully to avoid missing any important details.
- Search online for the error message, as it's possible that others have encountered and solved the same problem.
- Consider using debugging tools or stepping through your code line by line to identify where the error is occurring.
- If you're still having trouble resolving the issue, don't hesitate to provide us with the error message, and we'll try our best to help you.
