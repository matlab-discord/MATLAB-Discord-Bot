## Error Messages
Error messages provide information about crashes and can help to identify their root cause. The **top** lines show the actual error message, and often suggest how to fix it.
### How to use the error message
1. Read the error message to understand the type of mistake. Google the message if it doesn't make sense.
2. Use the hyperlinks in the error message to isolate problem areas.
3. Identify and correct the issue. Use pause-on-errors and the debugger to find issues and to test your fix
*Trying* to fix your own problem is a great way to learn the language, but if you're still stuck, **ask for help**.
